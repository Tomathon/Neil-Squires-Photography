            <h2>A little bit about myself</h2>
            <p>After studying Photography at South Notts College for 4 years, earning a BTEC ND and a BTEC HND, I was fortunate enough to land a job in the Production department at sport photography agency Empics. This job involved editing, retouching and captioning pictures for some of the best sport photographers in the country.</p>

            <p>During the first few years in the job I got to travel and be an onsite editor at some of the world's biggest sporting occasions:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>2002 European Athletics Championships in Munich</li>
                <li>2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan </li>
                <li>2003 World Athletics Championships in Paris</li>
                <li>2004 UEFA European Championship in Portugal</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In 2004 Empics was taken over by the Press Association and through technical developments such as Shootlive the need for editors to be at events became less and less. As my job became office based I was able to develop my skills in Photoshop more, and through the backing of the Press Association I was able to become Adobe Certified.</p>
            
            <p>My spare time has been spent developing my own photography and in particular my love of landscape photography. After all these years Iâ€™m now getting to the point where I have confidence to show my work. I hope you like it.</p>
